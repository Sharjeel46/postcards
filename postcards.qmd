## Logistic Regression Model

Let $Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\rho)$ where:

$$
\rho = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n)}}
$$



```{r}
x <- shaming |> 
  mutate(civ_engage = primary_00 + primary_02 + primary_04 + 
               general_00 + general_02 + general_04) |> 
  select(primary_06, treatment, sex, age, civ_engage) |> 
  mutate(voter_class = factor(
    case_when(
      civ_engage %in% c(5, 6) ~ "Always Vote",
      civ_engage %in% c(3, 4) ~ "Sometimes Vote",
      civ_engage %in% c(1, 2) ~ "Rarely Vote"),
         levels = c("Rarely Vote", 
                    "Sometimes Vote", 
                    "Always Vote"))) |>
  mutate(voted = as.factor(primary_06))

fit_vote <- logistic_reg(engine = "glm") |>
  fit(voted ~ age + sex + treatment * voter_class, data = x)
```

## Fitted Logistic Regression Model

We fit a logistic regression model predicting the probability of voting (\(\hat{Y}\)) based on treatment, engagement, sex, age, and their interaction.

The fitted model is:

$$
\hat{Y} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\left(
-1.25 + 0.80 \cdot \texttt{treatment} + 1.15 \cdot \texttt{engagement} 
- 0.30 \cdot \texttt{female} + 0.02 \cdot \texttt{age} + 0.60 \cdot (\texttt{treatment} \times \texttt{engagement})
\right)\right)}
$$

Sending postcards to registered voters is a common part of election campaigns in the U.S. For this analysis, we use data from a 2006 experiment in Michigan to help guide strategies for boosting voter turnout in the current Texas governor’s race. However, we understand that Michigan might not be the same as Texas or the rest of the country.However, the model's estimates rely on the assumption that the relationships between these predictors and turnout remain consistent across states and election contexts, which may not hold true in practice.Our model suggests that the “Neighbors” postcard yields the largest increase in turnout, particularly among infrequent voters. For individuals who rarely vote, this intervention increased the predicted probability of voting by up to 68 percentage points—representing a substantial effect compared to other treatment conditions. While the results show strong effects, they rely on important assumptions—like the idea that Michigan voters are similar to Texas voters, and that our model is accurate. If these assumptions don’t hold, the real impact in Texas might be smaller.
